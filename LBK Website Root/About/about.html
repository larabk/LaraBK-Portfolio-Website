                <h1>A little blurb about me...</h1>

                    <p>I made new keys - because old keys do not open new doors.</p> 

                    <p>For as long as I can remember, my life revolved around my passion for technology 
                    and building. As a kid, I'd take apart computers and audio electronics just to see 
                    how they worked and "Frankenstein" them back together. This curiosity lead me to an 
                    18 year career in the AudioVisual industry. I started as an audio engineer working live events, 
                    progressed through various roles to a Project Manager for an AV organization, and simultaneously 
                    owned and operated a live event production/installation company.</p> 

                    <p>As a life-long learner, I was searching for better ways to apply my favorite skills within 
                    different technologies. Through this exploration and as my interests grew, I discovered my 
                    absolute love of programming. Software Development encompasses all that I am passionate about; 
                    technology, creativity, problem solving, and building.</p> 
                        
                    <p>I'm currently enrolled at Tech Elevator and after graduation I'll be looking for a 
                    Junior Software Development role. My goal is to make meaningful contributions in the 
                    workplace by expanding on the technical skills I've gained while bringing with me the 
                    diverse skillset I've acquired along the way.</p>
